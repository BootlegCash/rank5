        <h1 class="gradient-text">🍻 What is Ranked Drinking?</h1>
        <p>Ranked Drinking is a gamified way to track your drinks, share your night, and climb the leaderboard — all while staying safe and having fun.</p>
    </div>

    <!-- Why It Was Created -->
    <div class="glass-card section">
        <h2 class="gradient-text">✨ Why We Built It</h2>
        <p>
            This started as a fun idea among friends — how can we make drinking together more memorable and a little less chaotic? 
            We wanted a way to track our drinks, compete for bragging rights, and keep each other accountable. 
            Ranked Drinking was born from nights out, inside jokes, and the simple goal of turning parties into stories worth saving.

    <!-- Game Mechanics -->
    <div class="glass-card section">
        <h2 class="gradient-text">🎮 How the Game Works</h2>
        <ul class="about-list">
            <li><strong>Track your drinks</strong>: Log beers, shots, and mixers in real time.</li>
            <li><strong>Earn XP</strong>: Get experience points based on what you drink (and lose some if you go too far... 🤢).</li>
            <li><strong>Level up</strong>: Progress through ranks like Bronze, Silver, Diamond, and ultimately — Steez 👑.</li>
            <li><strong>Compete with friends</strong>: Add friends, compare stats, and race to the top of the leaderboard.</li>
            <li><strong>Unlock achievements</strong>: Hit milestones and collect trophies for your wildest (or most responsible) nights.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <!-- Ranks -->
    <div class="glass-card section">
        <h2 class="gradient-text">🏅 Ranks</h2>
        <p>Every drink gets you closer to a new rank. But be careful — throwing up sets you back. Here's the current rank ladder:</p>
        <ul class="about-list ranks">
            <li>🥉 <strong>Bronze</strong> – 0+ XP</li>
            <li>🥈 <strong>Silver</strong> – 600+ XP</li>
            <li>🥇 <strong>Gold</strong> – 1300+ XP</li>
            <li>🔘 <strong>Platinum</strong> – 3200+ XP</li>
            <li>💎 <strong>Diamond</strong> – 7300+ XP</li>
            <li>👑 <strong>Steez</strong> – 15,000+ XP (MAX LEVEL)</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
